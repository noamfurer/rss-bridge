Out this weekend is WirePlumber 0.4.9 with some important fixes and improvements. <br /> <br />Perhaps most notable with WirePlumber 0.4.9 is ensuring surround sound support is properly exposed for more games on Linux. It was reported that some games within Steam were not able to enjoy 5.1 surround sound with PipeWire in a year-old bug report. A fix landed in WirePlumber a month ago to relax the format parsing within the si-audio-adapter module and this appears to fix up that issue. More details within <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire/-/issues/876">this bug report</a>. <br /> <br />WirePlumber 0.4.9 also has some crash fixes, addresses a race condition with the Zoom desktop app that could result in audio sharing to fail, Brave / Edge / Vivaldi / Telegram added to the Bluetooth auto-switch application list, and a variety of other fixes and minor improvements. <br /> <br />More details on WirePlumber 0.4.9 via <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/wireplumber/-/releases/0.4.9">FreeDesktop.org GitLab</a>.</div></div>

The <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Xen-pvUSB-For-Linux-5.17">Xen pvUSB driver was mainlined in Linux 5.17</a> after being out-of-tree for more than one decade. <br /> <br />But it turns out this new Xen USB driver was missing some verification/sanitization of data around I/O length, interrupt storms, and other missing safeguards. With Linux 5.18 this xen_hcd driver is now hardened against malicious backends/hosts from infiltrating the kernel through this driver's missing checks/safeguards. <br /> <br />The full list of USB/Thunderbolt changes for Linux 5.18 can be found via Greg KH's <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/Yj7vGtn8fILavjyL@kroah.com/">pull request</a> that was already merged to mainline.</div></div>

They found the current Linux kernel page reclamation handling is too expensive and can make poor eviction choices, but MGLRU has been showing to be a big improvement both for their internal workloads and by external parties testing the many public patch revisions.  <br />  <br />See <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linux-MGLRU-v9-Promising">some of the enticing MGLRU benchmark results</a> for workloads benefiting the likes of Apache Cassandra, Hadoop, Memcached, PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, FIO, and many other workloads. Or even for cases of running a web browser with many tabs when often facing system memory pressure and SWAP storms, MGLRU has kept systems in a usable state.  <br />  <br />Google's Yu Zhao today sent Linus <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20220326010003.3155137-1-yuzhao@google.com/">a pull request for MGLRU</a>. While the Linux 5.18 merge window is going on at the moment, Yu wasn't necessarily for pushing it right away, "<em>This is more of an option than a request for 5.18. I'm sending it to you directly because, in my judgement, it's now as ready as it'll ever be.</em>"  <br />  <br />In the Linux kernel mailing list thread for that pull request, Linus Torvalds said he isn't opposed to it but ultimately isn't going to pull it for Linux 5.18. The basis being that MGLRU hasn't been fully vetted by way of the linux-next tree. He wants to see this big patch series running in Linux-Next for a while to help uncover any issues especially with all the build automation/testing that goes on for Linux-Next.  <br />  <br />So at this stage it looks like Mutli-Gen LRU could enter Linux-Next for a cycle or so and if all goes well it could be merged for Linux 5.19 this summer. There's also more sign-offs that would be appreciated but the main reason for not merging into 5.18 is over the lack of Linux-Next exposure .  <br /><p align="center"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2022&image=mglru_v6" /><br /><em>Prior MGLRU developer summary.</em></p>  <br />Here's to hoping MGLRU makes it into Linux 5.19!</div></div>

IBT helps protect against JUMP/CALL oriented attacks. IBT is hardware-based, course-grain forward-edge Control Flow Integrity (CFI) protection. When enabled for the kernel build, it ensures indirect calls land on an ENDBR instruction. Besides all of the Linux kernel patches to make IBT a reality, there is compiler-side support necessary that means GCC 9 and newer or LLVM Clang 14 and newer. <br /> <br />Zijlstra sums up the CET-IBT functionality for the Linux kernel as: <br /><blockquote>Add support for Intel CET-IBT, available since Tigerlake (11th gen), which is a coarse grained, hardware based, forward edge Control-Flow-Integrity mechanism where any indirect CALL/JMP must target an ENDBR instruction or suffer #CP. <br /> <br />Additionally, since Alderlake (12th gen)/Sapphire-Rapids, speculation is limited to 2 instructions (and typically fewer) on branch targets not starting with ENDBR. CET-IBT also limits speculation of the next sequential instruction after the indirect CALL/JMP. <br /> <br />CET-IBT is fundamentally incompatible with retpolines, but provides, as described above, speculation limits itself.</blockquote> <br /><p align="center"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2020&image=intel_cet_tiger_med" /><br /><em>Intel has been working on both Shadow Stack and Indirect Branch Tracking support for the Linux kernel.</em></p> <br />With <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20220326152646.GT8939@worktop.programming.kicks-ass.net/">this pull</a> IBT is ready to go for Linux 5.18 on Intel's latest processors.</div></div>

The shared resources handling does require Wine patches which for right now is only patched with Proton Experimental. Right now this experimental shared resources handling works for 2D texture sharing between D3D9 and D3D11 when using DXVK from both APIs. Resource sharing with D3D12 and Vulkan applications may come in the future. <br /> <br />DXVK 1.10.1 also adds a <em>DXVK_ENABLE_NVAPI</em> environment variable to bypass the vendor ID override, improved shader code generation around local arrays, various Direct3D 9 texture upload issues resolved, and more. <br /> <br />There are known fixes/improvements for Assassin's Creed 3: Black Flag, Frostpunk, God of War, GTA: San Andreas, and Rayman Origins. <br /> <br />For those building DXVK from source while waiting for an updated Proton for Steam Play, head on over to <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v1.10.1">GitHub</a> for the latest DXVK code.</div></div>

While they have in past years been rather nimble with their Linux staffing, things continue to change thanks to their ongoing successes in the marketplace from the consumer side with Steam Deck through the likes of Tesla's infotainment system up through high-end server platforms.  <br />  <br />AMD over particularly the past 1~2 years has begun significantly ramping up their Linux hires thanks to EPYC servers being well received in the marketplace along with their supercomputer design wins and most of the servers these days running Linux. Then over the past year they have been <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=AMD-Linux-Client-Hiring-2022">focusing more on the Linux client side too</a> for Ryzen and embedded SoC designs with increasing Linux usage there too.  <br />  <br />In addition to <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=AMD-Linux-Jobs-March-2022">some of their Linux job postings from earlier this month</a> still being unfilled, they have also opened up some new positions.  <br />  <br />Notable with their latest batch of Linux openings is hiring a <a href="https://jobs.amd.com/job/Austin-Partnership-Engagement-EngineerArchitect-%28Open-Source%29-109981-Texa/779997700/">CXL engineer</a>. This role will focus on AMD's support for Compute Express Link (CXL) hardware enablement under Linux. Intel so far has been leading the development of the Linux kernel's <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=search&q=Compute+Express+Link">Compute Express Link</a> subsystem. Over the past number of kernels with the still maturing CXL subsystem Intel engineers have been responsible for nearly all of that enablement work for this new open standard. AMD has been part of the CXL organization so it's good to see them now (albeit late) hiring to work on CXL for Linux too.  <br /><p align="center"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=amd-epyc-7773x-linux&image=amd_milanx_8_med" /><br /><em>AMD's newly released EPYC Milan-X processors are a fantastic performer under Linux already but certainly eager to see more timely contributions to the Linux kernel for next-gen platforms and relentless optimizing for new and existing hardware, especially considering Intel's vast open-source/Linux talent pool and their massive scale of open-source work across the board.</em></p>  <br />Over on the client side, another new job opening is for a <a href="https://jobs.amd.com/job/Austin-Client-Platform-Validation-&-Debug-Lead-128221-Texa/820607400/">client Linux platform debug lead</a>. This will focus on desktop/notebook platform debugging for Linux. Great to see they'll have an additional person helping to work through Linux client bugs, including mentioned in the job posting are around power management / system standby -- an area where some modern AMD Ryzen notebooks have had issues on Linux with s2idle, etc, but more recent kernels have begun working through those problems.  <br />  <br />There remains a number of other open Linux engineering positions too. Those on the hunt can see <a href="https://jobs.amd.com/search/?createNewAlert=false&q=Linux&locationsearch=">the AMD Linux job board</a>.</div></div>
